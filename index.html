                <h1>DSA Practice</h1>
                <p class="modal-info">Why this project?
                <p>To showcase my progress in leetcode.</p>
                </p>
                <p class="modal-info">Why the tech stack?
                <p>
                    I chose a full-stack framework like Next.js for its built-in routing, API support, and server-side rendering. Pairing it with TypeScript helped catch errors early and kept the codebase maintainable.
                </p>
                <p >
                    Although I had no prior experience with Next.js and only a basic understanding of TypeScript, building this project gave me hands-on experience. I'm still learning, but I now have a strong grasp of how both tools work together and individually.
                </p>
                </p>
                <p class="modal-info">Challenge:
                <p>Working with @monaco-editor and vm2. The tests were generated by chatgpt and gathered from leetcode, but problems have different parameters and I had to figure out how to spread the parameters correctly.
                    In short, I overcomplicated it.</p>
                </p>
                <p class="modal-info">What I would add:
                <p>As of right now, I have only completed easy leetcode problems. In the future, I be doing medium and hard problems. This means the tests will need to be categorized accordingly.</p>
                <p>Another thing I'd like to add is the choice to use a difference language. Languages I want to answer these problems in are Python and C#.</p>

                <p>My brother plans on having employees in the future, where they could have android or ios phones. React Native deploys to both, and I'm also comfortable using React already.</p>
                </p>
                <p class="modal-info">Challenge:
                <p>Learning react native at a deeper level as I only learned the superficial layer of it in school. As well as using a UI library and several 3rd party dependencies.</p>
                </p>
                <p class="modal-info">What I would add:
                <p>Job scheduler, different tiers of quotes, an improved website for the client to view the quotes, role based auth as his employees should only have access to certain endpoints.</p>

                <p class="modal-info">Challenge:

                <p class="modal-info">Challenge: <p>Since every language was new to me, it was learning all of them individually and also how they work together. After playing with each language,

                <p class="modal-info">Why this project?<p>At first, it was to test my vanilla javascript skills and make a game at the same time. Quickly into making the project, I thought about adding socket.io for players to play against eachother,
                    as well as an AI the player can play against in either easy,medium, or hard mode. Found out very quickly I suck at chess.
                </p></p>
                <p class="modal-info">Why the tech stack?<p>To test my vanilla javascript knowledge since my previous two projects were written with React.</p></p>
                <p class="modal-info">Challenges<p>Learning chess. The more I learned about chess the more complex the project became.</p></p>
                <p class="modal-info" >What I would add<p>Socket.io so two players can play against eachother. As well as a system that allows the user to gain points with each match they play, so they can earn enough points to purchase
                     a chess set that they can play with. There are currently four chess sets for both black and white.

                <p id="about-content">This sounds cliché, but my journey started when I first printed "Hello,  World!" to a screen. I'm someone 
                    who is obsessed with anything that is endlessly progressive. Whether in video games, sports, or real life,
                     if there is a way to progress without limit, I'm game. When I watched "Hello World!" print on my screen, I imagined a 
                      virtually limitless world, that was when I knew this profession is for me. <br/><br />My hobbies include coding, gaming, working out, and thinking about project ideas that never start.
                      I tinker with robotics, Arduino in particular, as I also see a limitless journey in the world of robotics.
